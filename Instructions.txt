This file shortly describes the project and output.

1. The program is aimed to classify the transactions based on the information about customers, receivers, and other parameters, like fraudality, suspicious behaviour, date, how often the transactions are made in the given time frame, and other parameters
2. The final version of the program is customersAnalysis_v3.R script
3. Program inputs are : customer_data.csv and request_data-2.csv
4. Program temporary outputs are:
--"customersModified.csv"" (customers data, removed duplicate ids, and added some coefficient columns based on existing columns)
-- "requestsModified.csv" where some columns are added based on customers data and requests data (columns)
5. The final result of the program is the
--"classifiedRequests.csv" file, containing more important  columns that were generated by the program, based on the customers and requests data, and calculated coefficients, that classify the trensfers giving them rate from 0 -- the most suspicious transfers, that should be checked first, to 19 the most trustworthy transfers, with best customers

IDEA: The idea of the script is to make non zero coefficients depending on the given data, and then combine all those coefficients to final one (see: column decisionCoeff), and a more human readable classification/ranking by this coefficient: see column decisionRank in file "classifiedRequests.csv"
The script is completely flexible, some coefficients/functions used in the script (not in the output) are taken by the author's subjective impression, but could be defined based on more solid/sophisticated statistics. The author's intension was to provide an attitude to the problem and suggest some solution.

Thanks for getting here ;)
